    <h2>Early Years</h2>

    <p>I grew up in South Dakota, and lived in small towns until I left for Marine Corps bootcamp at the age of 17.  My computer background started when my dad purchased a TRS80 and bought computer magazines with pages of programs in them.  We would hand enter these programs and runt them until we turned it off.
        We were estatic when the industry came out with a tape backup so we did not lose everything when the computer was turned off.</p>

    <h2>USMC</h2>

    <h4>1992</h4>

    <p>I enlisted the day after I turned 17 and was guaranteed electronics due to a GT score of 132 on my ASVAB. On July 23, 1992 I left for bootcamp and was assigned to platoon 2057 at MCRD in San Diego, CA and graduated on Oct 23, 1992.
     In Jan 1993 I went to 29 Palms, CA for Ground Radio Repair Course amd graduated Oct 1993.</p>
     
     <h4>1993</h4>

    <p>My first duty station was 2nd FSSG at Camp LeJune, NC.  I was stationed there for about 2 1/2 years before going to Okinowa, Japan for my last year.
    In Okinowa I was stationed 3rd Mar Div on Camp Courtney.</p>    

    <h2>Civilian Life</h2>

    <h4>1997</h4>

    <p>Shortly after getting off of active duty I started working at Advanced Technology Labratories as a test technician in the service department repairing power supplies for UM4/UM5 ultrasound product line.  In less than 90 days I was hired on full time when most would be a temp for a year and a half.  In 2001 ATL was purchased by Philips.</p>

    <h4>2000</h4>

    <p>In Jan 2000, I re-enlisted into the Marine Reserve in Camp Murry, WA.  After early pay issues and getting married I got out of the reserves after only one year. </p>

    <h4>2004</h4>

    <p>In 2004 I was given the oppourtunity to work on PC based ultrasound systems.  These systems were consumer based PC parts running Embedded Windows XP and Windows 7 with a proprietary ultrasound application.  I spent many hours, late at night and on the weekends learning PC's with my dad.  The thing that really intrigued me was a CD my dad gave that I was not able to run.  This disk ended up being live version of KNOPPIX. I was blown away knowing that I did not need to install this software to run it.  Once my dad explained to me how it worked, I was frustrated because I did not know Linux let a lone how to run it.  When I was not on the phone with my dad learning things about PC's, I was running this CD trying to learn Linux and using tools like Ethereal (now Wireshark).  After figuring this out I started downloading distro's at work due to my home connection being limited to 115kbytes from my 3G cellphone.</p>

    <h4>2010</h4>

    <p>Around 2010 I found out that time I regretted getting out of the Marine Corps due to seeing coworkers choosing what parts of their jobs they felt like doing.  <strong> This would not fly in the Marine Corps.</p></strong>

    <h4>2013</h4>

    <p>Around this time I had been playing with computers for a while and stumbled onto a person called Johnny "I Hack Stuff", which turned me onto to Google Dorking.  After reading sections of his book I was just as intrigued with what and how you can pull information from Google as much as I was about being able to run an operating system from a CD/DVD.</p>

    <h4>2015</h4>

    <p>In Sept 2015, I felt my time at Philips had run its course.  I took about 2 months off before my next job.  In Nov 2015 I started as a Tribal Gaming Agent, doing something that I had never done but was very eager to learn all the aspects of my new position.</p>

    <h4>2018</h4>

    <p>In Aug 2018 I decided to go back into electronics due to not being fullfilled as a Tribal Gaming Agent.  After going on two interviews and one phone interview I received 2 offers.  The first offer was not what I needed for compensation for the commute that I would endure so I accepted the second position.  This is where I currently work, testing and repairing power control modules for several commercial and defense aircraft.  Shortly after starting at Crane A.E., I felt like this was not a place I wanted to be long term due to no communication or team work even one the lowest levels.  This is my drive to do well during this code camp.</p>

    <h4>2019</h4>

    <p>In late 2019 I started teaching myself Python.  I have been interested in Python for several years and finally got the motivation to learn it.</p>
